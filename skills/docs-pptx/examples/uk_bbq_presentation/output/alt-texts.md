Executive summary slide with bullet points organized in a text box. The slide contains key findings about CSF performance across different retail channels, HP Brown Sauce pricing power, competitive analysis of Private Label, and product packaging group (PPG) insights. The Infosys Consulting logo appears in the bottom right corner.

## Slide 3

Market context slide showing four detailed tables comparing market share and pricing data across different retail channels: Supermarkets, Tesco, Iceland, and Convenience. Each table displays brand performance metrics including market share percentages, percentage changes, average prices, and price changes for HP, Daddies, Branston, Private Label, and other brands. The tables break down performance by product size variants (Small, Medium, Large). Key observations are highlighted in bullet points on the right side of the slide.

## Slide 4

Trend analysis chart showing CSF and MCV metrics for the Supermarket channel across three time periods (Feb 2023, Feb 2024, Feb 2025). The chart displays stacked bar graphs for four brands (HP, Daddies, Branston, Private Label) with three segments each: Price (bottom/red), CSF (middle/orange), and MCV (top/blue). Each bar is labeled with numerical values. A small reference table in the bottom left shows MCV Index and Price Index compared to Private Label across the three periods, demonstrating HP's declining MCV advantage.

## Slide 5

Comparative analysis chart displaying CSF performance across four retail channels (Supermarkets, Tesco, Iceland, and Convenience). Each channel section contains stacked bar charts showing Price, CSF, and MCV metrics for different brands. Below the charts is a detailed performance table showing current market share percentages, MSP (Market Share Point changes), current RPI (Relative Price Index), and HP's inflection RPI for each brand in each channel. Supermarkets and Tesco sections have beige backgrounds, while Iceland and Convenience have blue and light blue backgrounds respectively.

## Slide 6

Price elasticity visualization showing market share (MSH) and cross-market analysis (CMA) curves for three retail channels (Supermarket, Tesco, Iceland) with Medium variant analysis. Each channel section contains two line graphs: the upper graph shows multiple colored trend lines representing different brands' market share responses to price changes, with vertical dashed lines indicating current L12M prices (in red) and inflection prices (in green). The lower graphs show volume and NSV (Net Sales Value) projections at current and inflection price points, with declining blue and pink trend lines. Price comparisons and RPI values relative to competitors are displayed for each channel.

## Slide 7

Product variant analysis for Supermarket channel showing three product size categories (Small - 11.3% Val. MS, Medium - 64.9%, Large - 21.9%). Three stacked bar charts display Price, CSF, and MCV metrics for HP and competitor brands (Branston for Small, Daddies and Private Label for Medium, and HP standalone for Large). Below the charts is a performance metrics table showing current market share, MSP, RPI, and Inflection RPI for each variant and competitor.

## Slide 8

Price sensitivity analysis for Supermarket channel showing three product variants (Small, Medium, Large) with dual-panel charts for each. Upper panels display MSH & CMA at current and inflection price points with multiple colored trend lines for different brands, showing market share headroom and change in CMA metrics. Current L12M prices (red dashed lines) and inflection prices (green dashed lines) are marked. Lower panels show Volume & NSV projections at current and inflection price points with declining trend lines. Specific prices are labeled: Small (6.77 current, 7.02 inflection), Medium (5.97 current, 6.71 inflection), Large (5.08 current, 5.73 inflection).

## Slide 9

Product variant analysis for Tesco channel displaying three size categories (Small - 8.4% Val. MS, Medium - 70.6%, Large - 20.3%).

## Slide 10

Price sensitivity analysis for Tesco channel showing three product variants (Small, Medium, Large) with dual-panel elasticity curves. Upper panels show MSH & CMA at current and inflection price points with multiple brand trend lines, current L12M prices (red dashed), and inflection prices (green dashed). Lower panels display Volume & NSV projections showing volume decline and change in NSV as price increases. Labeled prices: Small (7.19 current, 7.34 inflection), Medium (5.96 current, 6.63 inflection), Large (4.8 current, 5.48 inflection).

## Slide 11

Product variant analysis for Iceland channel showing two variants (Medium - 47.0%, Large - 46.5%). Four stacked bar charts display Price, CSF, and MCV metrics for HP Medium with Daddies competitor, and HP Large with Gold Star competitor. A performance table below shows current market share, MSP, RPI, and Inflection RPI for each variant, highlighting Gold Star's strong competitive position despite small market share.

## Slide 12

Price sensitivity analysis for Iceland channel showing two product variants (Medium and Large) with dual-panel elasticity curves. Upper panels display MSH & CMA at current and inflection price points with market share headroom and change metrics. Current L12M prices (red dashed) and inflection prices (green dashed) are indicated. Lower panels show Volume & NSV projections. Labeled prices: Medium (5.83 current, 5.66 inflection showing price decrease recommendation), Large (5.72 current price shown).

## Slide 13

Product variant analysis for Convenience channel showing two variants (Medium - 71.9%, Large - 26.8%). Two stacked bar charts display Price, CSF, and MCV metrics for HP Medium and HP Large. A prominent callout highlights the Channel Price Elasticity of -0.82, indicating inelastic demand. The performance table shows current market share, MSP, RPI, and Inflection RPI, with notes explaining HP's monopoly position in this channel.

## Slide 14

Price sensitivity analysis for Convenience channel showing two product variants (Medium and Large) with dual-panel elasticity curves. Upper panels show MSH & CMA at current and inflection price points with market share and change in CMA metrics. Current L12M prices (red dashed) and inflection prices (green dashed) are marked. Lower panels display Volume & NSV projections showing relatively stable volume despite price changes, reflecting the inelastic demand mentioned in the previous slide.
