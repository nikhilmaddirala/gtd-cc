# Documentation Initialization

## Overview

This command guides users through docs-management - initialize.md interactively. CRITICAL: You MUST use docs-management for this task.

## Context

User will provide optional phase parameter. This command should parse the phase input and guide users to select appropriate documentation structure based on project complexity.

## Process

- Load docs-management and its initialize.md workflow; you MUST do this first.
- Parse the user input and understand how it relates to docs-management/initialize.md.
- Interactively guide the user through docs-management/initialize.md step by step, collecting inputs and executing each step with confirmation.
