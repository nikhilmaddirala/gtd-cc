Executive Summary

Overall
Overall CSFs are healthy in Supermarket, Tesco & Convenience – implying satisfied consumers with low switching tendency
Iceland CSFs are relatively lower due to price sensitive consumers, limiting consumer stickiness in that channel

HP Brown Sauce
HP Brown Sauce retains pricing power across Supermarket, Tesco & Iceland
Consumers are less likely to switch to other brands when HP increases price – instead, they tend to exit the category or channel altogether. HP can consider strategic price increases to gain value share

HP is the only brand available in the Convenience channel
With no branded competition and a channel price elasticity of -0.82, HP faces relatively inelastic demand — meaning volume is less sensitive to price changes. This provides room to modestly increase prices without significant volume loss, allowing HP to improve margins while still preserving channel volume

Competition
Private Label has the strongest CSF in Supermarket and Tesco despite 7–10% price increases
However, PL has limited price interaction with HP, reducing immediate switching risk

PPG
Discontinuation of Large Variant in Daddies and Private Label, only HP retains the Large Variant; However, within HP PPGs, the Large Variant's CSF is low in Supermarket and Tesco, suggesting limited consumer preference for the size

UK – Brown Sauce – Market Context - (Mar'23 – Feb'24 v/s Mar' 24 – Feb'25)

Supermarkets
Change in: Value = -3.4%; Volume = -3.5%; Price = 0.1%
Tesco
Change in: Value = -1.8%; Volume = 3.7%; Price = -5.3%
Overall value of Brown Sauce category is declining across all Channels

HP has maintained a relatively stable market share within Supermarkets and Tesco
However, HP has lost distribution in Medium Variant of Iceland Channel which seems to be the cause of losing share in that Channel

Medium Variant increasing in Market Share across channels indicating increasing consumer preference towards that PPG

Both, Daddies and Private Label, have discontinued Large Variant completely

Private Label Medium variant is gaining market share in Supermarket and Tesco, despite recent price increases.
