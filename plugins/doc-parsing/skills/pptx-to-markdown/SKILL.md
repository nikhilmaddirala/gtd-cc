# PPTX to Markdown Conversion

Convert PowerPoint presentations to markdown format with inline slide images and AI-generated alt-text descriptions. The conversion produces a complete markdown document suitable for documentation, archival, version control, or AI analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for PowerPoint presentations that need markdown conversion for:

- Documentation and archival of presentation content
- Making presentations accessible to AI analysis workflows
- Creating searchable, version-controllable presentation archives
- Generating accessible presentations with detailed alt-text
- Preserving presentation content in a portable text format

## Conversion Workflow

The conversion has two main phases:

**Deterministic (scripted):**
1. PPTX → PDF conversion using LibreOffice
2. PDF → JPEG slide images using poppler-utils
3. Text extraction using markitdown
4. Markdown assembly with inline images

**Non-deterministic (AI-assisted):**
5. Alt-text generation using multimodal image understanding

## Step 1: Run the Conversion Script

Execute the provided Python script to handle all deterministic conversion steps:

```bash
./scripts/convert_pptx_to_markdown.py <input.pptx> <output_dir>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/convert_pptx_to_markdown.py source/presentation.pptx output/
```

**Optional flags:**
- `--dpi 150` - Image resolution (default: 150, higher=better quality/larger files)
- `--title "Custom Title"` - Override auto-detected presentation title

**Output structure:**
```
output/
├── presentation.md              # Final markdown with inline images
├── presentation-text.md         # Extracted text (intermediate)
├── pdf/
│   └── presentation.pdf         # Generated PDF (intermediate)
└── slide-images/
    └── slide-01.jpg ... slide-N.jpg  # Slide images at specified DPI
```

**Requirements:**
- LibreOffice (soffice command)
- poppler-utils (pdftoppm command)
- Python 3.11+ with uv

See references/troubleshooting.md for installation instructions for your operating system.

**Progress output:** The script shows progress for each step and reports any errors with clear messages.

## Step 2: Generate Alt-Text Descriptions

After the script completes, create detailed image descriptions for accessibility:

1. Read all slide images in `output/slide-images/`
2. Analyze each slide's visual content:
   - Chart types and structure (bars, lines, tables, dual-panels)
   - Color schemes and what they represent
   - Key data points and trends
   - Layout and visual hierarchy
   - Business insights from visualizations
3. Write comprehensive descriptions to `output/alt-texts.md`

**Format for alt-texts.md:**
```markdown
# Alt-Text Descriptions

## Slide 1

[Detailed description of title slide, branding, layout]

## Slide 2

[Description of chart type, colors, data structure, insights]

...
```

**Alt-text best practices:**
- Describe chart types explicitly (stacked bars, line graphs, tables)
- Explain color coding and what colors represent
- Note key data points and trends visible
- Include business context where relevant
- Make descriptions useful for both screen readers and AI analysis

## Step 3: Validate Output

Verify conversion succeeded:

- [ ] All slides converted to images (count matches slide count in presentation)
- [ ] Final markdown created with inline image references
- [ ] Images display correctly when viewing markdown
- [ ] Alt-texts.md created with descriptions for all slides
- [ ] No error messages in script output

**Quick validation:**
```bash
# Count slides in output
ls output/slide-images/slide-*.jpg | wc -l

# View the final markdown
cat output/presentation.md
```

## Troubleshooting

If the conversion script fails, see **references/troubleshooting.md** for solutions to common issues:

- LibreOffice not found or conversion errors
- Image export failures with poppler-utils
- System library errors with markitdown
- Missing slide markers in extracted text
- Broken image links in markdown

The troubleshooting reference includes detailed solutions, alternative approaches, and debugging strategies.

## Integration with CSF Workflows

This skill is particularly useful for CSF presentation processing:

- Convert Stage 7 (Presentation) deliverables to markdown for archival
- Generate alt-texts that capture chart types and business metrics
- Enable searching across presentations for specific analyses
- Version control presentation content alongside code and data
- Make analytical insights accessible to AI workflows

When working with CSF presentations, pay attention to:
- Color schemes (typically red/orange/blue for Price/CSF/MCV)
- Dual-panel comparison layouts (channel vs channel analysis)
- Stacked bar charts showing component breakdown
- Performance tables and metric comparisons

## Example

See **examples/uk_bbq_presentation/** for a complete reference conversion:
- Source: 15-slide CSF study presentation
- Output: Markdown with inline images and detailed alt-texts
- Demonstrates: Business analytics charts, dual-panel layouts, color-coded metrics

View the example to understand expected output format and alt-text patterns.

## Best Practices

- **Preserve originals**: Never modify source files in shared folders; work with copies
- **Validate immediately**: Check each conversion before moving to alt-text generation
- **Descriptive alt-texts**: Make descriptions valuable for both accessibility and AI understanding
- **Consistent DPI**: Use 150 DPI for good quality/size balance (adjust if needed)
- **Version control**: Commit markdown outputs to track presentation changes
- **Document process**: Note any special handling needed for specific presentations

## Key Files

- **scripts/convert_pptx_to_markdown.py** - Main conversion script (Python with uv)
- **references/troubleshooting.md** - Common issues and solutions
- **examples/uk_bbq_presentation/** - Complete reference example

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Run conversion script
./scripts/convert_pptx_to_markdown.py source/presentation.pptx output/

# 2. Generate alt-texts (AI-assisted)
# Read slide images and write detailed descriptions to output/alt-texts.md

# 3. Validate results
ls output/slide-images/ | wc -l  # Should match slide count
cat output/presentation.md        # View final markdown
```

The script handles all deterministic steps with proper error handling. Focus on generating high-quality alt-text descriptions that preserve the analytical and visual context of the presentation.
