Single entry point for humans: use `gh-manage` (triage/orchestrate) to route work.

- **gh-manage** (manager/dispatcher): triage vague asks, label, and orchestrate to plan/build/review/merge with full context.
- **gh-plan** (planning): research and produce implementation plans ready for autonomous execution.
- **gh-build** (implementation): implement plans, update PRs, run tests, and hand off for review.
- **gh-review** (review/approval/merge): code review, human approval guidance, and merge/cleanup.
- **gh-ops** (governance/hygiene): repo setup, labels/templates/protections, issue creation/management, and commit assistance for human-made main changes.
- **_common**: shared guidelines, lifecycle labels, and templates for plans, PR reviews, and approvals.
