description: Develop detailed implementation plans with options analysis for GitHub issues
---

Use the gh-plan skill and follow its plan workflow exactly as written.

**Target Issue**:
- If $ARGUMENTS is empty, you will show the user recent issues with "needs planning" label and ask them to select one
- If $ARGUMENTS contains only digits, treat it as an issue number
- If $ARGUMENTS contains text, search for matching issues from the recent list
