# Monorepo Git Configuration
# ===========================
# Copy this file to .monorepo-git.yaml in your repo root and customize.
# All settings are optional - the plugin uses sensible defaults.

# Subtree detection
# -----------------
# Pattern for identifying subtree remotes in `git remote -v`
# Default: "remote-" (matches remote-project-a, remote-my-config, etc.)
subtree_remote_prefix: "remote-"

# Default branch for all git operations
# Default: "main"
default_branch: "main"

# Subtree mappings (REQUIRED for publish/status)
# -----------------------------------------------
# Explicit remote-to-directory mappings. This is the source of truth for
# which monorepo directory corresponds to which subtree remote.
# Without this, the plugin cannot reliably determine which prefix to use
# for `git subtree push`, risking pushing wrong content to remotes.
#
# subtrees:
#   remote-project-a:
#     prefix: "path/to/project-a"
#   remote-project-b:
#     prefix: "path/to/project-b"
#
# Example:
# subtrees:
#   remote-gtd-cc:
#     prefix: "40-code/41-public/gtd-cc"
#   remote-dragonix:
#     prefix: "40-code/42-private/dragonix"

# Directory structure for graduate workflow
# -----------------------------------------
# These paths are used by /mg-graduate to suggest source and target directories.
# If not set, graduate will prompt the user for paths explicitly.
#
# directories:
#   lab: "path/to/lab"           # Development/experimental projects
#   public: "path/to/public"     # Public production projects
#   private: "path/to/private"   # Private production projects
#
# Example for a typical monorepo structure:
# directories:
#   lab: "projects/lab"
#   public: "projects/public"
#   private: "projects/private"
